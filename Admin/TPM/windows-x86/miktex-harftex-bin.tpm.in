    <TPM:Description>
    HarfTeX is a TeX engine based on LuaTeX and aims to combine the
    flexibility of LuaTeX with comprehensive support world languages
    and writing systems more-or-less out of box (Ã  la XeTeX).

    HarfTeX started as an attempt to integrate the HarfBuzz text
    layout library into LuaTeX as a Lua module and a Lua support
    package, allowing users to benefit from a mature, well supported
    and featureful text layout engine. However, the LuaTeX team
    preferred to avoid the extra dependencies and suggested building a
    separate engine instead.
