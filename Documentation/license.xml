<title>Redistributing &MiKTeX;</title>

<date>April, 2017</date>

</articleinfo>

<section>

<title>Copying conditions for &MiKTeX;</title>

<para>To the best of our knowledge, all software in the &MiKTeX;
distribution is freely redistributable (libre, that is, not
necessarily gratis), within the Free Software Foundation's definition
and the Debian Free Software Guidelines.  Where the two conflict, we
generally follow the &FSF;.  If you find any non-free files included,
please contact us (references given at the end).</para>

<para>That said, &MiKTeX; has neither a single copyright holder nor a
single license covering its entire contents, since it is a collection
of many independent packages.  Therefore, you may copy, modify, and/or
redistribute software from &MiKTeX; only if you comply with the
requirements placed thereon by the owners of the respective
packages.</para>

<para>To most easily learn these requirements, we suggest checking the
&MiKTeX; package catalogue: <ulink
url="&hqbaseurl;packages">&hqbaseurl;packages</ulink>.  Of course the
legal statements within the packages themselves are the final
authority.</para>

<section>

<title>Guidelines for redistribution</title>

<para>In general, you may redistribute &MiKTeX;, with or without
modification, for profit or not, according to the usual free software
tenets.  Here are some general guidelines for doing this:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>If you make any changes to the &MiKTeX; distribution
or any package it contains, besides complying with any licensing
requirements, you must prominently mention such changes in your
modified distribution so that users do not take your work for ours,
and know to contact you, not us, in case of questions or problems.  A
new top-level README.<replaceable>yourwork</replaceable> file is a
good place to describe the general situation.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Especially (but not necessarily) if changes or
additions are made, we recommend a clearly different title, such as
<quote><replaceable>Your work</replaceable>, based on &MiKTeX;
<replaceable>x.y.zzzz</replaceable></quote>, where
<replaceable>x.y.zzzz</replaceable> is the version of &MiKTeX; you are
using.  This credits both our work and yours.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>You absolutely may <emphasis>not</emphasis> place your
own copyright on the entire distribution, since it is not your work.
Statements such as <quote>all rights reserved</quote> and <quote>may
not be reproduced</quote> are especially reprehensible, since they are
antithetical to the free software principles under which &MiKTeX; is
produced.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>You may use any cover or media label designs that you
wish.  Such packaging and marketing details are not covered by any
&MiKTeX; license.</para>
</listitem>

<listitem><para>Finally, we make the following requests (not legal
requirements):</para>

<orderedlist numeration="loweralpha">

<listitem><para>Acknowledging that &MiKTeX; is developed as a joint
effort by all &TeX; user groups, and encouraging the user/reader to
join their user group of choice, as listed on the web page <ulink
url="http://tug.org/usergroups.html">http://tug.org/usergroups.html</ulink>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Referencing the &MiKTeX; home page: <ulink
url="&hqbaseurl;">&hqbaseurl;</ulink>.</para></listitem>

</orderedlist>

<para>Such information may be placed on the label of your media, your
cover, and/or in accompanying text (for instance, in the
acknowledgements section of a book).</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Finally, although it is certainly not a requirement, we'd like
to invite any redistributors to make a donation to the project,
whether cash or in-kind, for example via <ulink
url="&hqbaseurl;giveback">&hqbaseurl;giveback</ulink>.  Thanks.</para>

<para>If you have any questions or comments, please contact us.  In
general, we appreciate being given the chance to review any
&MiKTeX;-related material in advance of publication, simply to avoid
mistakes.  It is much better to correct text on a CD label or in a
book before thousands of copies are made!</para>

<para>We are also happy to keep anyone planning a publication informed
as to our deadlines and progress.  Just let us know.  However, be
aware that &MiKTeX; is produced entirely by volunteers, and no dates
can be guaranteed.</para>

</section>

<section>

<title>Licensing for new packages</title>

<para>Finally, we are often asked what license to use for new work.
To be considered for inclusion on &MiKTeX;, a package must use a free
software license, such as the &LaTeX; Project Public License, the
&GNU; General Public License, the modified &BSD; license, etc.
(Please use an existing license instead of making up your own.)
Furthermore, all sources must be available, including for
documentation files.</para>
