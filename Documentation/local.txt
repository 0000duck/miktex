## Local Guide to LaTeX for MiKTeX Users

MiKTeX doesn't differ very much from any other TeX system you might
have used before.  Typesetting with MiKTeX involves these steps:

1. Start TeXworks and edit your LaTeX document.
2. Press Ctrl+T to create a typeset view of your document.

Thank you for giving MiKTeX a try!
