## Reporting a bug

### How to write a good bug report

Before creating a bug report, please check this list:

1. check the [MiKTeX FAQ](https://miktex.org/faq)
2. write down a one-liner which summarizes the problem
3. perform an Internet search with the one-liner as the query

Make sure that others will be able to reproduce the bug by providing:

- **step-by-step reproduction instructions**:
  describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details
  as possible
- **input files which are necessary to reproduce the bug**
- **your observations**: command output, screenshots
- **log files**

### What happens next

A MiKTeX developer will receive a notification. If the bug is
reproducible, it will be a attached to a milestone with an estimated
fix date.

Unreproducible bugs usually lead to queries. So be prepared to make
available additional information.

Sloppy bug reports will be closed (or deleted) without comment.
