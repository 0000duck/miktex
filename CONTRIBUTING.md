## Reporting a bug

### How to write a good bug report

Before creating a bug report, please check this list:

- check the [MiKTeX FAQ](https://miktex.org/faq)
- search the issue tracker to see if the problem has already been reported

Make sure that others will be able to reproduce the bug by providing:

- **step-by-step reproduction instructions**:
  describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as many details
  as possible
- **input files which are necessary to reproduce the bug**
- **your observations**: command output, screenshots
- **log files**

### What happens next

A MiKTeX developer will receive a notification. If the bug is
reproducible, it will be a attached to milestone with an estimated fix
date.

Unreproducible bugs usually lead to queries. So be prepared to make
available additional information.

Sloppy bug reports will be closed without comment. If this happens
several times, the user will be blocked for a certain period of
time. This cannot happen if you have read the contribution guidelines
(this document).
