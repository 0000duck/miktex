# MiKTeX Software Copying Conditions

To the best of my knowledge, all components of the MiKTeX software are
freely redistributable (libre, that is, not necessarily gratis),
within the Free Software Foundation's definition and the Debian Free
Software Guidelines.

That said, the MiKTeX software has neither a single copyright holder
nor a single license covering its entire contents, since it is a
collection of many independent components.  Therefore, you may use the
MiKTeX software only if you comply with the requirements placed
thereon by the owners of the respective components.

To most easily learn these requirements, I suggest checking the source
code.
